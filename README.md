# Streamables
A responsive web app that allows users to search for a show or movie and see what streaming service it is viewable on in Canada as well as take the user there directly or they can watch the trailer.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, Netlify.

My goal for this project was to make a simple UI for users to search for shows and movies and see what streaming service it's on. This project was focused on using props, states and hooks to create the entire app and was a passion project I've always wanted to create.


## Optimizations

To improve this project, I will refactor my code so it's more efficient and so the CSS isn't all in one file but broken up based on each React component.

## Lessons Learned:

I really enjoyed building this project as I learned a lot and it forced me to challenge myself to build something I didn't entirely know how to build at first. It taught me to find and come up with solutions to some of the challenges I faced detailed above and to have an attitude of perseverance and resilience.

This project helped me solidify my React knowledge/skill and it taught me how to manipulate props, states and hooks in unique ways to display information to users the way I wanted.

It also taught me a valuable lesson about why and when it is important to have and use a backend. Through this, I got the opportunity to discover serverless and Netlify functions and how they handle the server-side code.

Lastly, I learned about debouncing and why it's important for projects like this because you don't want to be making an API call for every letter a user types into a search bar.
